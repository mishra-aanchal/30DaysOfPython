### Hi there!👋🏻
I'm currently revisiting and strengthening my Python fundamentals — focusing on writing cleaner code, mastering core concepts, and building hands-on confidence.

Resourses:

* Geeks for geeks
* [30 days of Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python)</br>

---
I’ll continue updating this repo as I brush up each concept day by day.
