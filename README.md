### Hi there!👋🏻

I’m revisiting and strengthening my Python fundamentals by following [Asabeneh’s](https://github.com/Asabeneh) 30 Days of Python.</br>
This repository contains all my notes, exercises, and mini-projects as I work through the series.

Resourses:

* [30 days of Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python)</br>
* Geeks for geeks
---
I’ll continue updating this repo as I brush up each concept day by day.
